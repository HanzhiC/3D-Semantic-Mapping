# 3D-Semantic-Mapping
This is part of my semester project taken in Computer Vision &amp; Geometry Lab, ETH Zurich, Switzerland, aiming to create a pipeline for real-time 3D semantic mapping. The whole system is built on InfiniTAM V3 and new module: semantic fusion has been added.Currently support both CPU and GPU implementation.\\
Further update and illustration will be proposed soon.
